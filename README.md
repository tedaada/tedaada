## Hi there 👋


## Who am I?

My name is Jeremie Drouet, a french 🥖 developer.

I'm a senior Rust 🦀 software engineer and I'm available for hire.

If you're interested in hiring me, you can contact me [here](mailto:hire@jdrouet.fr).

## What I'm working on, on my free time?

-  a Rust 🦀 rewrite of [mjml](https://mjml.io/) that boosts performances.
- a git extension to store metrics related to your project, written in Rust 🦀.

Those projects are motivated by the lack of privacy 👀 or the carbon footprint of the existing alternatives 🌍.

With the current climate changes, it's the developer's duty to build lightweight and energy efficient softwares.
